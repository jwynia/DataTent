        <Description>
            DataTent is a simple JSON datastore that uses a folder per data type. 
            It's intended for small projects and prototyping. 
            In a similar way to how a tent is intended for quick, temporary shelter.
            Most of the features you're about to ask for are trying to turn a tent into a house.
            As soon as you find yourself reaching for those other features, take the neatly formatted JSON files from this and import them into a more premanent datastore.
            Suggestions for how to make it a better **tent** are welcome.
