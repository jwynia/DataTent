# DataTent
A lightweight/temporary datastore of JSON files in folders. 

It is a tent, not a house, not an office building, and not an industrial warehouse. It's intended for quick prototypes, small projects, projects with a need to quickly store data, but without the overhead of bigger data store approaches.

Many of the features you're already wanting to add to this are an indication you don't want to live in a tent. You want an RV, a house, or something larger with more features. Those are signs it's time to move on to something else. Fortunately, since DataTent is just folders full of JSON files, you can easily take your data with you and migrate to whatever more robust data storage tool you choose. Godspeed.
